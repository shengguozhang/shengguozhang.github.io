        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> I am from Beijing. I am a native Chinese speaker. I graduated from Teacher University in China and have teacher certification. I had been worked in a high school for 5 years. I also got two master degrees. One was got in China. The other one was got in NYU. I have been living in New York City for ten years. I have better understand two different cultures of China and America.
I am working on my PhD degree in New York City. I am a Chinese teacher in one private school in NYC now.
I have very rich experience of tutoring Chinese. I have at least 8 years tutor Chinese here in NYC. I was a volunteer of Chinese tutor in Columbia University when I was working there in Chemistry department.
I use the most popular Chinese textbooks. I find these Chinese textbooks are very useful. Many Chinese learners like them and their Chinese level improve so quickly.
I like to be a teacher. I enjoy tutoring people learn Chinese. I am very patient and can use many different useful methods to teach Chinese.
I deeply believe one thing: Every one can speak fluent Chinese because more than one point three billion people can speak Chinese. So can you.
Letâ€™s conquer Mandarin together.
